This program was made from "Ready to Program Java IDE" (a very old app for writing JavaScript), so I am not sure if it will work elsewhere.

This was the first video game I made, so it will contain very unbalanced battle mechanics (the story is the main goal - although its writing may be odd)

There were multiple music embedded into this project, but they were too large. :c
